This is an new project (my first in python so the code still sucks) to make an ubunt/mint onedrive client

To install:

- make anaconda env from enviroment.yml 
 python remkodrive.py
 
 If you don't know how to do this, don't use this app yet...Still very much in development...
 
 btw who has experience with setup tools ? (haven't had time to figure it out yet) so i can give this to some friends to test
 
 Known issues:
 
 - in case of copy on computer it deletes the old and reuploads (not fun if there are big files in there!)
 - Move the same
 - if you delete files in your webbrowser on your onedrive they will  be reuploaded
 - no decent delta token implementation (basically on startup it always compares all files on date/time last modified)
 
 Do not use this in production yet!
 
 It will put an icon in the traybar like for example insync does
 
 (guys, its my first project on python, don't be to harsh...will soon clean up the code...i am an android app developer by nature)
 
 
 HELP  WELCOME! (specially from people who made clien apps on python before).
