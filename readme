This is an new project (my first in python so the code still sucks) to make an ubunt/mint onedrive client

To install:
- sudo apt-get install python-qt4
- make anaconda env from enviroment.yml 
- python remkodrive.py
 
 If you don't know how to do this, don't use this app yet...Still very much in development...
 
 Known issues:
 
 - in case of copy on computer it deletes the old and reuploads (not fun if there are big files in there!)
 - Move the same
 - if you delete files in your webbrowser on your onedrive they will  be reuploaded
 - no decent delta token implementation (basically on startup it always compares all files on date/time last modified)
 
 This is still in development. No garantee given or implied!
 
 It will put an icon in the traybar like for example insync does
 
 (guys, its my first project on python, don't be to harsh...will soon clean up the code...i am an android app developer by nature)
 
 
 HELP  WELCOME! (specially from people who made clien apps on python before).

 copyright: You have the right to copy. (gnu or something, anyway i won't bother you)
