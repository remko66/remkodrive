RemkoDrive a onedrive client for Mint and Ubuntu (well, only tested on mint)



To install:
- sudo apt-get install python-qt4
- make anaconda env from enviroment.yml 
- python remkodrive.py
 
 You can also run it from the mint menu
 
 If you don't know how to do this, don't use this app yet...don't have an install script yet.
 
Known issues:
 
 - in case of copy on computer it deletes the old and reuploads (not fun if there are big files in there!)
 - Move the same
 - if you delete files in your webbrowser on your onedrive they will  be reuploaded
 - no decent delta token implementation (basically on startup it always compares all files on date/time last modified)
 
 This is still in development. No garantee given or implied!
 
 It will put an icon in the traybar like for example insync does
 
 
 HELP  WELCOME! (specially from people who made client apps on python before).
